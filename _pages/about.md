I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Climate and Space Sciences at the University of Michigan, working in computational atmospheric science at both weather and climate scale. 

## Research Interests:
  * Intermediate-complexity test cases for Atmospheric General Circulation Models
  * Dynamics of the deep atmosphere; impact of the non-traditional Coriolis terms.
  * High-resolution climate modeling in CESM and E3SM
  * Uncertainty Quantification in Earth System Models
