The dynamical core in Atmospheric General Circulation Models makes a series of simplifying assumptions in order to efficiently model fluid flow on a global scale. Historically, models AGCMs have had horizontal grid spacings larger than 50km and model tops in the upper stratosphere. As a result, their dynamical cores made two (then reasonable) assumptions: 1) that the strength of gravity is spatially constant in the atmosphere and 2) neglecting certain terms of the Coriolis force, in order to maintain energy conservation. I am currently working on a project in the HOMME dynamical core to add a so-called deep-atmosphere configuration, which removes these two assumptions.
