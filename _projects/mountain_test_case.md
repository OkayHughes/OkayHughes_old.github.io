Atmospheric models benefit from idealized tests that assess their accuracy in simplified configurations. We developed a new test with artificial mountains for models on a spherical earth. The mountains trigger the development of planetary-scale Rossby and small-scale inertia-gravity waves. These can be analyzed in dry or moist environments with a simple rainfall mechanism. We intercompare four dynamical cores from atmospheric models. This sheds light on the pros and cons of the model designs and the impact of mountains on the flow.
