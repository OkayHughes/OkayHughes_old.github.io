I'm a computational atmospheric scientist at the University of Michigan who is most interested in the computational fluid models called Dynamical Cores (Dycores) that lie at the heart of climate and weather models.

I had the idea of putting my lab notebooks online for all to see. This isn't a particularly useful idea in and of itself, but I could see a number of future projects that might be able to build on this.

            Burned all my notebooks!
            What good are notebooks?
            They won't help me survive.
